First-time offenders will be suspended from the service for one year. Second-time offenders will be suspended from the service for two years, and third-time offenders will be suspended from the service for three years, and so forth.

In addition to the penalty clauses above, NCHC may pursue civil or criminal suits against offenders depending on the severity of the offense.

If an Account is not associated with any effective project—for example, a project with a positive balance or an unexpired project duration—and no project application has been submitted to NCHC for more than three months, NCHC will notify the User and make a confirmation by sending an e-mail. If there is no objection, NCHC will remove the User’s account and remove your files from the system, including the home directory.
