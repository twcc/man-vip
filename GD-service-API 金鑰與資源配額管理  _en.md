## API Key

The TWCC system provides each tenant with an API Key (master key), which varies depending on the project, user, and tenant roles. This key allows you to use TWCC services through API calls. Key Management page provides key information, extension, additions, deletions, etc. Please manage the keys properly.

* Click your name in the upper right corner and click "API Key".
