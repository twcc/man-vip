# Interactive Container image

TWCC provides a variety of optimized container images for NGC AI computation, and also provides the ability to save custom images you have deployed by yourself. All project members can share them. With this service, all software requires only one installation, providing you with the convenience of quickly copying and deploying the same environment.

Moreover, since billing starts when an interactive container is created, if a container is no longer needed, you can use image to store its settings, then delete it to reduce your cost and restore the container from the image on the next time you need it. In addition, you can use container images as a disaster recovery for container damage.

:::info
About detailed description, please refer to [<ins>TWCC Container Image overview</ins>](/docs/ccs-interactive-container/concepts/container-images.md)ã€‚
:::

:::caution
1. The scope of the custom image does not include the data in the default directories /home and /work of the container. Please note the installation location of the packages before creating an image. Python package installation notes can be found at [<ins>Python package installation guide</ins>](https://man.twcc.vip/en/docs/ccs/tutorials/python-package-installation-guide).
2. When you store more than 10 GB of data in the container system directory (not /home or /work directory of [<ins>Hyper File System (HFS)</ins>](https://man.twcc.vip/en/docs/hfs/intro)), the container image might not be created normally.<br/>
You can check used capacity of the container system catalog `/` by entering the command `df -h`.

:::info
If an image has a duplicate tag name, it will overwrite the original completed image and refresh the last update time on the Image Management page.

* After the container image is created, it will appear in the list of Image Request History. It takes a few minutes to finish the creation of container image. At this time, the request status shows **`requested`**.
