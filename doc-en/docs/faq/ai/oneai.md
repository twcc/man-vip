<summary> Q3. What is the difference between OneAI AI Maker and AI Maker(Beta)?</summary>

AI Maker(Beta) feature adds MLflow integration to manage the details of model training.
1. [<ins>AI Maker(Beta) > MLflow Tracking</ins>](https://docs.oneai.twcc.ai/s/3uxGFglX0#%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86) manageable model lifecycle.
2. AI Maker(Beta) > Training Job for a task the built-in template training model automatically applies MLflow to provide a more detailed AI/ML research process: using custom training codes requires manual configuration in the code. [MLflow Logging Function <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#logging-functions)feature provides centralized management of models through OneAI user interface.

Please refer to [<ins>OneAI AI Maker(Beta)</ins>](https://docs.oneai.twcc.ai/s/3uxGFglX0#AI-Maker%EF%BC%88%E6%90%B6%E9%AE%AE%E7%89%88%EF%BC%89) for more information.

## Container usage

<details>

<summary> Q1. What is the scope of OneAI Container Service Port?</summary>

OneAI Container Services offers a range of static ports from  30000-32767ã€‚please refer to [<ins>OneAI Container Services > Network Setting</ins>](https://docs.oneai.twcc.ai/s/yGbG4JJyi#3-%E7%B6%B2%E8%B7%AF%E8%A8%AD%E5%AE%9A) for more information.

</details>

<details>

<summary> Q2. How should the OneAI container image be generated?</summary>

Prepare your container image and use the Docker CLI to push the container image file to OneAI container image. Docker CLI information can be found in the [official Docker documentation<i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/#cli-references).

</details>

<details>

<summary> Q3. Can OneAI Container Service use SSH connection?</summary>

Depending on the image, the source will restrict SSH connections. The system's built-in nvidia-official-images public image is available through an SSH connection. If you want to use SSH connection, it is recommended that you [install the sshd related packages<i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://docs.docker.com/samples/running_ssh_service/) in the image. OneAI Container Service uses SSH connection, please refer to the [<ins>user manual</ins>](https://docs.oneai.twcc.ai/s/yGbG4JJyi#%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8-SSH-%E7%99%BB%E5%85%A5%E9%80%A3%E7%B7%9A) for more information.

</details>

<details>

<summary> Q4. Why does the size of the container image get smaller when I upload from my local environment?</summary>

The OneAI container image will compress the container image file you uploaded, resulting in a smaller container image file with no effect on its contents.

</details>

## Data Storage

<details>

<summary> Q1. What kind of data storage services are available for OneAI?</summary>

OneAI uses the [<ins>OneAI Storage Service</ins>](https://docs.oneai.twcc.ai/s/_F4C_EzEa#%E5%84%B2%E5%AD%98%E6%9C%8D%E5%8B%99) as a data storage and management tool, providing secure and reliable storage compatible with Amazon S3 and supporting third-party tools(S3 browser)that enable data sharing between OneAI's services or with other project members.

## Training Model

<details>

<summary> Q1. Does OneAI support multi-GPU training?</summary>

OneAI AI Maker public templates automatically distribute deep learning models and large training sets across multiple GPUs, while custom training code needs to be manually tuned to invoke GPUs, and the invocation method will vary depending on the deep learning framework.

</details>

<details>

[<ins>SmartML Training Tasks</ins>](https://docs.oneai.twcc.ai/s/QFn7N5R-H#%E8%A8%93%E7%B7%B4%E4%BB%BB%E5%8B%99) has 4 types of algorithms to choose from:Bayesian, TPE, Grid, Random to perform optimization strategies for model training. If you don't use public template, you must use `os.environ` in your training code to [<ins>Manually configure variable settings</ins>](https://docs.oneai.twcc.ai/s/QFn7N5R-H#23-%E8%A8%AD%E5%AE%9A%E8%B6%85%E5%8F%83%E6%95%B8) to set tunable hyperparameters, model types, etc. For more information, please refer to [<ins>Public template image-classification case study</ins>](https://docs.oneai.twcc.ai/s/6FCAc5sdI#AI-Maker-%E6%A1%88%E4%BE%8B%E6%95%99%E5%AD%B8---%E5%BD%B1%E5%83%8F%E5%88%86%E9%A1%9E%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B%E6%87%89%E7%94%A8) setup.

</details>

<details>

<summary> Q3. What model types can be imported into OneAI AI Maker models?</summary>

OneAI models can store unlimited types of models. Before importing, you need to package the model as a ZIP file and upload it to OneAI storage service. Please refer to [<ins>AI Maker models</ins>](https://docs.oneai.twcc.ai/s/QFn7N5R-H#%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B) for more information.

</details>

<details>

<summary> Q4. How can I confirm that GPU resources are being used?</summary>

- The compute resources used by OneAI Notebook Service, Container Service and Inference Service can be monitored through [<ins>OneAI Resources</ins>](https://docs.oneai.twcc.ai/s/gEQO9lvF8).
- For OneAI training assignments, you can check the status of your computing resources within 7 days, please contact customer service and get monitoring data.
