# Image sharing history

Go to the **Image Sharing Management** page to view the name, target project, state and creation time of the shared images.

Once shared, the image state changes to **`approved`** (still in the process of sharing), and shows **`finished`** (sharing complete) after the sharing is over. Members in the target project can use the shared image to [Create a custom instance](/user-guides/twcc/vcs/instances/create/create-custom-instances.md).

Only Tenant Admins can view their own (not project-wide) image file sharing information.
