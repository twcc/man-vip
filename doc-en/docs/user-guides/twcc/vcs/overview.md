Virtual Compute Service Instance is a traditional general host rental service provided by TWCC. It can be quickly deployed and recycled through automated tools and processes, and has the ability to mount multiple virtual disks at the same time, create data disks, and freely and flexibly allocate instance storage space, which makes it the best choice for both intelligent calculation and cost-saving.

With the load balancing and auto scaling mechanism, you can set the conditions for the utilization of system resources. The system automatically detects and flexibly scales up or down the processing environments and resource allocation. There is no need to worry about being forced to interrupt the computation due to system overload.
