On the **VCS Instance Management** page, we provide shortcut buttons for instance operation for you:

- Click **ï¼‹CREATE** to create your first instance. Check [Create an instance](/user-guides/twcc/vcs/instances/create-instances) for more creation details.
- View a list of created instances with basic instance information, and perform action on your instance: delete or reboot/start/stop an instance. Check [Stop/start/shutdown/restart/delete an instance](/user-guides/twcc/vcs/instances/details/stop-start-reboor-shutdown-delete-instance.md) for more details.
