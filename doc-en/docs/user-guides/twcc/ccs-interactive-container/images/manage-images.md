# Manage images

After creating a custom image, you can view the image information or delete the image you no longer use on the **Image Management** page.

## View information

* Click **Interactive Container** from the service list, and click **Image** on the left to go to the **Image Management** page.

* You can view the image information on this page, including the name, tag, size, last updated time, and last retrieved time.

## Delete images

On the **Image Management** page, click on the  <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-v fa-20" aria-hidden="true"></i> on the right side of the image and then click on **DELETE** to delete the container.

* Or you can select multiple images and then click on **DELETE** to finish batch deletion.

:::info
- Last updated time: Once the tag name is repeatedly created for the same container, the new image will replace the original image with the same tag and update the time.
- Last retrieved time: The time you used the image to create a container.
