# Container storage

TWCC Hyper File System (HFS) is pre-configured as the container storage and is a fully-managed file system designed specifically for AIHPC to accelerate computing performance.

Also, you can store container data in TWCC Cloud Object Storage (COS). COS supports various data type storage with huge capacity and can be fetched over the network (supports S3 protocol). You can manipulate storage with API or a friendly user interface.

See [Hyper File System (HFS)](/docs/user-guides/twcc/hfs) and [Cloud Object Storage (COS)](/docs/user-guides/twcc/cos) for the service overview and user guides.
