# Resolve cannot receive SMS verification code

In order to verify your identity and phone number, you need to enter the verification code received via SMS message to complete the sign-up process.

However, if the following situations occur, the mobile phone may not receive the verification code, please follow the instructions according to your circumstance to resolve with:

### Circumstance 1. Weak cell phone signal or blocked signal
 
- Please make sure that the signal is normal, or resend it later.

### Circumstance 2. Blocking apps on your mobile phone 

Your phone is installed with blocking apps (e.g., whoscall) to block the marketing calls or is set up a blacklist.

- The verification code is sent by bulk SMS, so it is likely classified as a marketing call. Please make sure the relevant number is not blocked to avoid failure of receiving the message.

### Circumstance 3. Enable the "Reject Enterprise SMS" feature

Telecommunications companies provide "Reject Enterprise SMS" services, that automatically refuse to receive corporate SMS messages, which may result in failure to receive the verification code message normally.
- Take Chunghwa Telecom as an example (as shown in the figure below), log in [emome](https://www.emome.net/) website, and click 「**我的 emome(my emome)**」>「**申請服務(Apply for service)**」> then click「**拒收企業簡訊(Reject Enterprise SMS)**」, and make sure this service is "**disabled**". If you have already applied for it, it may cause your cell phone not to receive the verification code message normally.
- If you are unfamiliar with the process, call the customer service of your telecommunications company and complete the change through voice service.

### Circumstance 4. An exception in setting up the messenger app on the phone

Because of the different settings of mobile phone brands, there may be multiple apps that receive text messages (such as Google Messages, Facebook Messenger, or other text messaging apps) in the mobile phone at the same time. However, there can be only one app that receive messages, so the setting might be changed during the system update or an exception occurs. 

- Make sure the app has been updated to the latest version, and clear memory cache. Take the Android 10.0 mobile phone as an example, please "**Clear Data**" and "**Clear Cache**" of the app you receive the text messages, and make sure to use only one single app to receive the SMS, to avoid multiple receiving at the same time.
