# TWCC FAQs | Basic Virtual Firewall (BVF)

<details>

<summary> Q1. Why don't the rules inside the firewall work?</summary>

Firewall rules will be affected by the order of the rules. Please go to the firewall details page and edit the order of the rules to move the order of your important firewall rules to the first one before the firewall will give priority to them.
