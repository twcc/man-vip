<summary> Q2. Can I create a container for others to use?</summary>

When creating a container for others to use, you need to consider the following points:

* Your supercomputer password must be provided to others to connect to the container.
* /home and /work directory are your personal HFS storage space. The data and files might lost or damaged when used by others. Even if you open a new container, these changes cannot be restored.
* There will be data security risks when sharing computing resources. Please consider carefully.

Therefore, in addition to creating containers for others, you can add others to the project on the [<ins>Member Center <i class="fa fa-question-circle fa-question-circle-for-service" aria-hidden="true"></i></ins>](https://man.twcc.ai/@twccdocs/doc-service-main-zh/https%3A%2F%2Fman.twcc.ai%2F%40twsdocs%2Fhowto-service-access-service-zh) so that the user can create containers on his own.
