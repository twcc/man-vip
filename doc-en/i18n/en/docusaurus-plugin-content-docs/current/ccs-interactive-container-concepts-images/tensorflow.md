TWCC provides a total of 20 ready-to-use working environments of NGC optimized TensorFlow. TensorFlow is an open source library that uses data flow graphs to represent abstract numerical computing processes. The nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the edges represent multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. This flexible architecture makes it easy to perform computations on different devices without rewriting code, such as PCs with one or more CPUs/GPUs, smart mobile devices, etc.

Those with the same version number but distinguishing `tf2` and `tf1` are different in the TensorFlow versions.; distinguishing `py3` and `py2` are different in the PyTorch versions.
