# Activate Windows

Once VCS Windows instance are created, please activate Windows with your licenses.

<br/>


## Activate using a digital license


Digital license (called a digital entitlement in Windows 10, Version 1511) is a method of activation in Windows 10 that doesn't require you to enter a product key. Digital licenses are associated with your hardware and linked to your Microsoft account, so there's nothing you need to find on your instance. You're all set once your instance is connected to the internet and you log in to your Microsoft account. 

<br/>


## Activate using a product key


During installation, you'll be prompted to enter a product key.  Or, after installation, to enter the product key, select the 開始 (Start)  button, and then select 設定 (Settings)  > 更新與安全性 (Update & Security)  > 啟用 (Activation)  > 更新產品金鑰 (Update product key) > 變更產品金鑰 (Change product key).
