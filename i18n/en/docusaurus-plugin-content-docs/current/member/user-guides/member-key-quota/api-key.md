# API key management

The TWCC system provides each tenant with a master key (API key), which varies by the project, user, and role. With the key, you can use TWCC related services through API calls. "API Key" provides functions such as key information, period extension, adding, and deleting, etc. Please manage your keys properly.

* Click the user name in the upper right corner, and then click "API Key".
