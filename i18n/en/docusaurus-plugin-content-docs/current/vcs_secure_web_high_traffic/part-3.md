# Part 3ï¼šTest and remove non-essential resources

<TOCInline toc={toc} />

### Step 1. Test load balancing and secure connection

- Wait until the load balancer enters in the `ACTIVE` state, open your loacl browser and type  **`https://<Domain_Name>`** in the address bar.
- It will show the web page information set up by the instance `lbssl01` `(This is VCS lbssl01!)`, also, there will be a <i class="fa fa-lock" aria-hidden="true"></i> displayed as secure and encrypted connection in the upper left corner.

- Refresh again, and it will show the web page information set up by the instance `lbssl02`  `(This is VCS lbssl02!)`. This means the load balancing functions normally, and users are redirected to different web servers in a loop to distribute the traffic.

### Step 2. Remove non-essential resources: public IP

- After the website architecture and content are built, the non-essential public IP of the VCS instance can be removed, and it can be reopen when website maintenance.
