# Part 3: Verify the domain & secure connection

Verify the two websites belong to the same domain, and confirm the website can be opened and the connection is secure.

### Step 1. Verify the two websites belong to the same domain

- Open **Command Prompt** on your local machine and ping the two domain names separately to verify if it's the same domain (with the same IP address).

- From the figure above, we can see that the two domain names we ping (underlined in red) belong to the same domain (in the orange box)

### Step 2. Verify SSL Secure Connection
- Open your browser and enter the domain name:**`https://<Domain_Name>/`** or **`<Domain_Name>`**
